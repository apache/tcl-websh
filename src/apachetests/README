			 Tests for mod_websh
			 ===================
	  $Id$

Test suite for mod_websh.

This system attempts to analyze and use an installed Apache binary to
test the mod_websh installation.

To run the tests, from within the apachetests/ directory, do this:

./runtests.tcl /path/to/apache/binary/httpd

Note that the environment needs to be set properly. For easier setup, 
run this test suite from the ../unix or ../win direcotry using 
'make apachetest' (unix) or 'nmake apachetest' (win) respectively. 
This will setup the environment according to the parameters given when 
mod_websh was compiled (Tcl library, libwebsh.so, httpd ...)

The tests work by analyzing the apache binary (to see if it has the
necessary modules, and to see if it has mod_websh loaded).  After
that, a minimal configuration file is created and Apache is run in
single process mode (Port 8081, configured in runtests.tcl), to serve 
requests for the tests, which are in turn generated by Tcl's http package.
