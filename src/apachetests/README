			 Tests for mod_websh
			 ===================
	  $Id$

Testing system for mod_websh.

This system attempts to analyze and use an installed Apache binary to
test the mod_websh installation.

To run the tests, from within the apachetests/ directory, do this:

./runtests.tcl /path/to/apache/binary/httpd

for example:

@ashland [~/workshop/tcl-websh/src/apachetests] $ ./runtests.tcl /usr/sbin/apache
mod_websh.test: Total   1       Passed  1       Skipped 0       Failed 0

The tests work by analyzing the apache binary (to see if it has the
necessary modules, and to see if it has mod_websh loaded).  After
that, a minimal configuration file is created and Apache is run in
single process mode, to serve requests for the tests, which are in
turn generated by Tcl's http package.
