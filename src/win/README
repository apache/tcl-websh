Websh 3.6 Windows version
=========================

Please note that the Windows version is not being maintained properly at 
this time. Any volunteers?


Compiling Websh 3.6
-------------------

Websh 3.6 needs a file src\win\script.h which is not in the distribution.
This file is created from some tcl sources in the src\generic directory.

To create this file, open your favorite command shell ;-) and change to 
the directory src\win. The command

tclsh84.exe ..\generic\tcldecmt.tcl ..\generic\context.tcl ..\generic\script.ws3 ..\generic\cookie.ws3 ..\generic\sessctx.ws3 > script.h

will do the trick.
