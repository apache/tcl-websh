	* generic/tcldecmt.tcl: Add newlines/newline quoting backslashes
	to mirror the script in Tcl's initScript.

	* generic/cfg.c (Web_Cfg): cmdUrlTimestamp changes.

2001-11-22  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* generic/url.c (createUrlData): First cut at making cmdurl scheme
	bswitch between https and http depending on environmental variables.

	* tests/dispatch.test: Changes necessary here to correctly handle
	errors that are now propogated from web::dispatch.

	* generic/dispatch.c (Web_Dispatch): Propogate errors from
	parsePostData.

	* cfg.c: Added CMDURLTIMESTAMP as a global option that may be
	configured with web::config.

	* unix/configure.in: Added debugging flags.

	* generic/request_ap.c (requestFillRequestValues): Make
	requestFillRequestValues return TCL_ERROR instead of NULL.

	* generic/context.tcl: Added 'delete' proc for contexts.

	* Added apachetests directory.

	* generic/log.c (createLogData): Change logSubst to default to 0
	(off).

2001-11-07  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* generic/uricode.c (uriDecode): changed 'utf' to be a signed
	character, so that the comparison with 0 works on all
	architectures.

	* generic/tcldecmt.tcl: Extend functionality to do multiple files,
	and properly quote \ and " characters for use in a C string.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Replaced shell commands with more
	functionality in tcldecmt.tcl script.

	* webutl.c: fixed setting global var for web::response command
	* web::response error messages improved
	* quickref updated
	* web::dehtmlify bug fix

2001-01-21  Simon Hefti <simon.hefti@netcetera.ch>

	* sessctx.ws3 supports web::init 1 -create
	  which creates the session file, if it does not exists yet,
	  whithout throwing an error. Also, allow capitals in
	  session id's.

	* varchannel.c: let Tcl handle the global variables, especially
	  when ref counter > 0, Also, suppress error message which
	  Tcl leavs in the interp if a channel does not exist yet,
	  if we could create it successfully.

	* filecontext.test:  test "valid id" checker, and "-create" option
	  of filecontext

	* webout.test: test channel switching

	* args.c: new function argdbg to write out arguments

	* cookie.ws3: new init prototype requires additional,
	  optional argument (-create). Added, even thouh it is unused here.

	* log.c: better check of valid options in web::logdest

2001-01-01  Simon Hefti <simon.hefti@netcetera.ch>

	* used -DTCL_MEM_DEBUG to find the last memory leaks. 2 found amd
 	fixed. A lot of "potentially leaked" (as indicated by purify)
 	disappear if test suite is run in a seperate interp
	(using interp create) and interp is deleted afterwards. In other
 	words: this is housekeeping data that is properly freed when the
 	interp is destroyed.

	* parsing of multipart/formdata: more indicative log messages
 	hinting to the prominent boundary problem (a boundary with lots of
 	dashes makes it easy to overlook the first two).

	* varchannel: solved encoding problem by using Tcl_GetByteArray
 	instead of Tcl_GetString

	* web::dispatch tests: since bad postdata do not throw errors any
 	longer (websh tries to answer the request even in case of bad
 	postdata) we had to rewrite the tests which checked those
 	errors. log entry is checked now instead.
