1. Introduction
---------------

webshell is a rapid development environment for building powerful and
reliable web applications. It is a standard Tcl extension and is
released as Open Source Software. webshell is versatile and handles
everything from HTML generation to data-base driven one-to-one page
customization. At Netcetera, we have been using it for years for
virtually all our customer projects, which typically are E-commerce
shops or electronic banking applications.

webshell is maintained, enhanced, and distributed freely as a service
to the Open Source community by Netcetera AG, Switzerland.

3. Compiling and installing webshell
------------------------------------

webshell is a pure Tcl extension, Tk is not required.  You need
Tcl8.2.2 or newer to compile and install webshell 3.

typically:

cd unix
./configure
make
make test
make install
make clean

If you have several versions of Tcl installed on your system, you
might want to specify which one should be used for webshell, e.g.

  ./configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/tcl8.3.2/lib \
      --with-tclinclude=/usr/local/tcl8.3.2/include/


4. mod_websh: webshell as Apache Module
---------------------------------------

webshell applications can both run in CGI mode and in mod_websh,
the module for Apache 1.3. In order to build mod_websh,
you have to use the following configure option:

  --with-httpdinclude=/path/to/apache/header/files

After this,

  make mod_websh.so

will compile and build mod_websh.

In order to use mod_websh in your Apache web server, you have
to do the following:

1) cp mod_websh.so somewhere where Apache can find it.
   e.g. libexec/
2) edit the httpd.conf file and add the following lines:
   LoadModule websh_module /path/to/apache/libexec/mod_websh.so
   AddHandler websh-script .ws3
3) HUP/restart httpd

From now on, httpd will pass files ending in .ws3 to mod_websh if the
files are

1) in a ScriptAlias'ed directory and
2)  executable and readable for the user under which httpd runs
