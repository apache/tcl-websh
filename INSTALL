To compile Websh:

from the top level directory,

cd src/unix
./configure
make

If you want to compile Websh as an Apache module:

make mod_websh.so

You may have to pass special options to configure, such as

--with-httpdinclude to indicate where the Apache header files are.

--with-tclinclude to indicate where the Tcl header files are.

--with-tcl to indicate where tclConfig.sh is located.

--enable-threads if you plan to use it with Apache 2 
  (don't forget to also compile Tcl with threads enabled).
