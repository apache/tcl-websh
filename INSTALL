Compile Websh 3.5.0
===================

from the top level directory,

cd src/unix
autoconf
./configure
make

If you want to compile Websh as an Apache module:

make mod_websh.so

You may have to pass special options to configure, such as

--with-tcl to indicate where tclConfig.sh is located.

--with-tclinclude to indicate where the Tcl header files are.

--with-httpdinclude to indicate where the Apache header files are
  (only needed to compile the Apache module).

--enable-threads if you plan to use it with Apache 2 
  (don't forget to also compile Tcl with threads enabled).


Websh provides the following targets
====================================

websh3.5.0
  standalone tclsh with websh package already loaded

libwebsh3.5.0.so
  Tcl package shared object (provides package websh)

mod_websh3.5.0.so
  Apache module for Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.0 respectively
