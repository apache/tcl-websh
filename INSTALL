To install Websh:

from the top level directory,

cd src/unix
./configure
make

If you want to compile Websh as an Apache module:

make mod_websh3.50.so

You may have to pass special options to configure, such as

--with-httpdinclude to indicate where the apache header files are.

--with-tclinclude to indicate where the Tcl header files are.

--with-tcl to indicate where tclConfig.sh is located.
