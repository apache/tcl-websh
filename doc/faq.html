<a name=" logging"><a href="#toc"><h2>2.1 How do I use the logging facility ?</h2></a>

Before webshell sends a message to a log destination, the message
needs to pass two filters. That's why you need to specify a level when
you issue a log message. First, webshell decides whether or not to
handle the log message. Then, it scrolls through the list of
registered log destinations and compares the log message level against
the filter of each log destination. The message is sent to the log
destination only if the message passes the second filter.

<br><br>
A log level consists of a tag and a level, separated by a dot.
Possible levels are
<ul>
<li>alert</li>
<li>error</li>
<li>warning</li>
<li>info</li>
<li>debug</li>
</ul>
The tag is free text. Typically, it is the name of the application, 
say &quot;foo&quot;.

<br><br>
Before log messages can reach their destination, you have to
&quot;open up&quot; the log destination, in two steps:
<pre>

web::logfilter add foo.warning-debug
web::logdest add foo.warning-info file foo_warn.log
web::logdest add foo.debug file foo_dbg.log

</pre>

This sequence of commands tells webshell to handle all messages
in the range &quot;warning&quot; to &quot;debug&quot;, if the level string is
&quot;foo&quot;, and to discard any other messages. Messages of level
&quot;debug&quot; are then written to file &quot;foo_dbg.log&quot;, while
the other messages end up in file &quot;foo_warn.log&quot;.

<br><br>
Issuing a message is easy:
<pre>

web::log foo.info &quot;Hello, world !&quot;

</pre>
