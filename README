1. Introduction
---------------

Websh is a rapid development environment for building powerful and
reliable web applications. It is a standard Tcl extension and is
released as Open Source Software. Websh is versatile and handles
everything from HTML generation to data-base driven one-to-one page
customization. At Netcetera, we have been using it for years for
virtually all our customer projects, which typically are E-commerce
shops or electronic banking applications.

Websh was originally developed by Netcetera AG, Switzerland and was
contributed to the Apache Software Foundation in 2001.

3. Compiling and installing Websh
---------------------------------

Please note that we use some GNU make extensions, so make sure that 
you try to compile Websh using a GNU version of make (or gmake) when
compiling under UNIX.

Websh is a pure Tcl extension, Tk is not required. You need
Tcl8.3 or newer to compile and install Websh 3.5.

typically:

  cd unix
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  make test

Make will create two targets: websh3.5.<patch>, which is the standalone 
Websh application (dynamically linked to Tcl) and libwebsh3.5.<patch>.so,
which is a TEA (Tcl Extension Architecture) shared object that can
be dynamically loaded from within Tcl using [load libwebsh3.5.<patch>.so].
Both provide the Tcl package websh.

If you have several versions of Tcl installed on your system, you
might want to specify which one should be used for Websh, e.g.

  ./configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/tcl8.3.4/lib \
      --with-tclinclude=/usr/local/tcl8.3.4/include/

Note that to compile mod_websh for Apache 2, the corresponding Tcl
library must be compiled using threads.


4. mod_websh: Websh as Apache Module
------------------------------------

Websh applications can both run in CGI mode and in mod_websh, the
module for Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.0. In order to build mod_websh,
you have to use the following configure option:

  --with-httpdinclude=/path/to/apache/header/files

For Apache 2, you need to enable threads additionally:

  --enable-threads

After this,

  make mod_websh.so

will compile and build mod_websh.

In order to use mod_websh in your Apache web server, you have
to do the following:

1) cp mod_websh.so somewhere where Apache can find it.
   E.g. SERVER_ROOT/libexec/
2) edit the httpd.conf file and add the following lines:
     LoadModule websh_module /path/to/apache/libexec/mod_websh.so
     AddHandler websh .ws3
3) Optionally, you can specify a mod_websh configuration file using the
   following directive:
     WebshConfig /path/to/websh.conf
   This configuration file is primarily used to configure the interpreter
   classes (see documentation)
4) HUP/restart httpd

From now on, httpd will pass files ending in .ws3 to mod_websh.
